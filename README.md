# IMDB---Webscraping-rating-prediction

Assignment 1:

Build a web scraping program to collect data from the IMDB top rated movies list. The link for
the URL is - IMDB Top rated movies

We expect the scraping program to do following tasks -
A) Click and visit the respective movie page and copy the following variables -
- Name of the movie
- Year released
- IMDB rating
- Number of reviewers
- Censor board rating
- Length of the movie
- Genre 1
- Genre 2
- Genre 3
- Genre 4
- Release date
- story summary
- Director Name
- Writer 1
- Writer 2
- Writer 3
- Star 1
- Star 2
- Star 3
- Star 4
- Star 5
- Plot Keywords list
- Budget
- Gross USA
- Cumulative worlwide Gross
- Production company


B) Provide the output in a csv/excel format. A sample file with IMDB rank 1 movie The
shawshank redemption is attached with the assignment. Please use this document as the
reference for output.


Final Output -
- Scraping algorithm
- Scraped data in csv/excel format


Assignment 2:

Assuming the success factor to be the IMDB rating of a movie, can you build a model to predict
these ratings given a subset of variables from the above data collection exercise.
For this exercise, you would need to estimate the effect of each of these variables on the output
variable. Now selecting a subset of these variables for building our model, we are trying to see if
IMDB ratings can be predicted to certain degree to help create winning combinations for movie
makers.
We recommend that you divide the dataset into 80% train and 20% test and try out multiple
methods to arrive at the best output. We request you to use evaluation metrics such as MAPE
(Mean absolute percentage error) on the test dataset to report the performance of a method.


Final Output
- Reproducible R/Python codes used for model building
- Step by step approach taken in a word document.
